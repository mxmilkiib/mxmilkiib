- 👋 Hiya, I'm interested in free/open music/art/communication software and related [data portability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_portability)
- 🔭 I’m slowly working on [libreav.org](https://libreav.org), and keeping notes on everything on [TnS Wiki](https://wiki.thingsandstuff.org)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to DJ (using [Mixxx](https://mixxx.org)) and produce music (DAW-less FOSS only)
- 💬 Promoting #lad, #jack and #lv2 IRC for FOSS audio developers, or the Matrix bridges. Also #libreav for release announcements.
- 🤔 Wondering why [JACK/LV2 CV](https://linuxmusicians.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=20701) isn't more popular, suggesting [DPF](https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF), and planning around [Seq66](https://github.com/ahlstromcj/seq66)
- 👯 Seeking participation of folk in improving [JACK wiki](https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki), [LV2 wiki](https://github.com/lv2/lv2/wiki), and libreav.org
- ❓ Ask me about JACK/LV2 CV, free/open source Linux music apps/plugins, festival work, dancing 
- 💭 Dreaming about the upcoming year of the Libre Audio Workstation; an inverted DAW assembled with elements of JACK/PipeWire, NSM, LV2, OSC, etc.
- 👎 Aiming to divest my life of proprietory systems (e.g. avoiding Discord)
- ✨ Waiting for the Matrix/Fediverse/SOLID Web 3.0 comms rerevolution
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
- 📫 How to reach me: Libera.Chat IRC
- ⚡ Possibly get Signal app?
- ✊ google Murray Bookchin
