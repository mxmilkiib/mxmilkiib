- 👋 Hiya, I'm interested in free/open music/art/communication software and related [data portability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_portability)
- 🌱 Learning how to DJ using [Mixxx](https://mixxx.org) ([repo](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx)), and working towards producing live music (DAW-less FOSS-only)
- ⚙️ Coding a set of Mixxx controller scripts for a mix of DJing, MIDI pattern sequencing, looping, etc

- 🤔 Wondering why [JACK/LV2 CV](https://linuxmusicians.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=20701) isn't more popular, suggesting [DPF](https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF) as a plugin framwork, and planning around pattern sequencer [Seq66](https://github.com/ahlstromcj/seq66)
- 👯 Seeking participation of folk in improving [JACK wiki](https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki), [LV2 wiki](https://github.com/lv2/lv2/wiki), and libreav.org

- 💭 Dreaming about the upcoming year of the Libre Audio Workstation; an inverted DAW assembled with elements of JACK/PipeWire, NSM, LV2, OSC, etc.
